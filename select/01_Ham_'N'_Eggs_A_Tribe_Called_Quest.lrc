[00:02.66] Chorus:
[00:21.35] I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
[00:26.39] A yo, Phife do you eat em? No, Tip do you eat em?
[00:28.42] Uh huh, not at all(again)
[00:30.76] I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
[00:36.07] Jarobi, do you eat em? Nope, Shah, do you eat em? (Nope)
[00:38.55] Not at all
[00:43.55] 
[00:40.67] Q-Tip and Phife(trading lines):
[00:42.30] A tisket, a tasket, what's in mama's basket?
[00:43.77] Some veggie links and some fish that stinks
[00:45.83] Why, just the other day, I went to Grandma's house
[00:48.40] Smelled like she conjured up a mouse
[00:51.17] Eggs was fryin, ham was smellin
[00:53.65] In ten minutes, she started yellin (come and get it)
[00:56.32] And the gettin's were good
[00:59.10] I said, I shouldn't eat, she said, I think you should
[01:01.65] But I can't, I'm plagued by vegetarians
[01:04.11] No cats and dogs, I'm not a veterinarian
[01:06.78] Strictly collard greens and a occasional steak
[01:09.72] Goes on my plate
[01:12.06] Asparagus tips look yummy, yummy, yummy
[01:14.28] Candied yams inside my tummy
[01:17.00] A collage of good eats, some snacks or nice treats
[01:19.67] Apple sauce and some nice red beets
[01:22.10] This is what we snack on when we're Questin'
[01:25.13] (Both: No second guessin)
[01:37.63] 
[01:27.11] Chorus:
[01:35.01] (Q-Tip: bridge)
[01:42.51] 
[01:38.48] Phife:
[01:41.20] Now drop the beat, so I can talk about my favorite tastings
[02:10.95] The food that is the everlasting, see I'm not fasting
[02:15.55] I'm gobbling, like a dog on turkey
[02:18.45] Beef jerky, slim jims, I eat sometimes
[02:21.05] I like lemons and limes
[02:22.88] And if not that, take it the road see and the salad sopped
[02:25.62] Sit back, relax, listen to some hip hop
[02:45.12] 
[02:28.52] Q-Tip:
[02:29.73] Gum drops and gummy bears tease my eyes
[02:30.98] A sight for sore ones and some bore pies
[02:33.53] And other goodies that are filled with goop
[02:36.00] With fried apple roots
[02:38.62] Delectable delights, control my appetites
[02:40.94] Mine is for me, right, but I know what I like
[02:43.69] Chicken for lunch, chicken for my dinner
[02:46.47] Chicken, chicken, chicken, I'm a finger lickin winner
[02:49.05] When breakfast time comes, I don't recognize
[02:51.29] Pig in the pan or a pair of bogey chides
[02:54.03] Mixed with stewed tomatoes, home fried potatoes
[02:56.47] Or anything with flair, cook it, I'm in there
[02:59.26] Pay attention to the Tribe as we impose
[03:02.35] This is how it goes
[03:11.85] 
[03:04.63] I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
[03:08.75] A yo, Phife do you eat em? Nah, Tip do you eat em?
[03:12.04] Uh huh, not at all(come again, y'all)
