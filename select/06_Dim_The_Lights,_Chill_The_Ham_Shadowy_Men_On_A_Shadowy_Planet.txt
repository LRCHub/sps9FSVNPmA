-- Dim the Lights and Chill the Ham

Cocktails for two,
Some knives... and some forks.
Beans, mashed potatoes,
A large mound of pork.
Oh can't you see
In my love eyes it's time
To dim the lights
And chill the ham?

Tape. Tape.
Tape. Tape...
Tape. Tape. Tape.
You bought a tape; that's great!
We'd like to say that you're the kind of person that
Takes our tape to the lake,
And listens to our tape while they're baking a cake.
You're the kind of person that makes our world go 'round.

That was excellent.

Shaking all over bonus track.
